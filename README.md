# Portfolio - Hungarian
This repository is created for the web development of the hungarian version of my portfolio website.

After the summer of '19 when I was front-end web developer intern I realized, this might be something I actually want to invest my time into.

**What's better than enjoying the work you do, while creating value to others?**

We had a week long break in the University, which I completely devoted into developing the basics of my own website.

This website would serve multiple purposes but the three main features of it would be:
- to gather and showcase each project of mine in a one place
- to experience website hosting, analyzing data and search engine optimization
- to help myself find a job in the future as software engineer

I had an immense amount of fun creating something so unique, exactly the way I wanted.
I feel like I've already achieved a lot with this project and I want to keep on improving it to successfully build my own brand as a side-business.

I hope I can showcase for hungarian people in the end of my journey that you can be the best version of yourself with the right mindset, hard work, humility and being kind to others.
